<H2>VIMMII - Vici Iterum MMII</H2>

The increasing amount of VIC20 demos for the unexpanded machine prompted
Aleksi Eeben to collect them together in an unexpanded VIC20 demo
collection. He also asked me if I had anything to release, perhaps I could
convert some of the
<A HREF="http://www.iki.fi/a1bert/Pu-239/vimm/">VIMM</A>
parts to run in the unexpanded machine.
 <P>
It took me a while to convert the DYCP part from VIMM, and again I
contacted Anders Carlsson for the music. He didn't disappoint me, and
produced a very small music player (track player) with a test music and a
little larger music player (duration player) with some tunes.
 <P>
I was talking about color splits with Aleksi, so I also demonstrated how to
get a lot of independent colors on screen with a routine, which later became
the second routine for the unexpanded demo collection, called 19-split.
 <P>
I continued converting the VIMM parts, and used all of my skills to fit
everything into the 5.5kB of RAM (color memory nybbles included) available.
Fortunately I always found some way to implement the effects or memory
management better than in the so-called original versions. Of course sometimes
sacrifices had to be made.
 <P>
The following chapters goes throught the parts in order, talks about the
general idea, code specifics, memory layout, how memory was saved, joystick
control and other hidden bonus features, in addition to how the part actually
performs and looks like.
 <P>
Note that only PAL VIC20 is currently supported.
 <P>


<H3>VIMMII.PRG</H3>

The first part does not have anything much to do, really. It performs a very
simple fadeout effect, which turns the screen black and off. In addition,
the loader routine is installed to the drive and to the computer memory
at location $31a-$3e3 so that it can be used by the following parts without
the need of reloading it each time. Page 3 is selected because zero-page and
stack, possibly also page 2 are used by the pucrunch decompressor.
 <P>
This part also starts the music for the first actual part and plays the music
while the part is loaded. I first had the next part in the same file,
but decided that the smaller the first part is the better.
 <P>

<H3>3k-vimmii</H3>

This part is a 3x2 16-line character font upscroller. The font originally took
3072 bytes so I had to do something to crunch it or there would not be any
space for code, not to mention music, after the font and the video matrix is
in place. I used a really simple dictionary compression that is also used by
big font designer programs in C64: identical 16-byte chunks in the font data
are left out and a mapping from the character code to the font is used when
writing to video matrix. I edited the font a little to make this character
packing more effective. After this the packed font takes 2032 bytes and the
mapping table 180 bytes. That's savings enough to fit everything else in,
so I stopped there.
 <P>

<H3>3k-vicpic</H3>

Vicpic displays a picture of resolution 100(w)x160(h). The format is in
general the same as in the previous
<A HREF="http://www.iki.fi/a1bert/Dev/vicpic/">vicpic</A> routine.
However, some sacrifices had to be made:
<UL>
<LI> no color bars on the sides, above, or below the picture
<LI> color memory resolution is 25(w)x10(h), saves 256 bytes + 256 nybbles
<LI> no "ALBERT" logo below the picture, saves 96 bytes
</UL>
In addition to filling every possible location with code, the multicolor
colors for each picture line are saved as nybbles to the color memory and
combined in the display code. Each picture is divided into two files so that
the colors and graphics can be loaded directly to the right memory areas.
 <P>
The picture display is turned off while a new picture is being loaded.
Pictures are loaded in order and when no more pictures are found, the
next part is loaded. VIMMII contains 10 pictures.
 <P>

<H3>3k-dycpi</H3>

a.k.a dycp unexpanded is the most traditional part. Nothing really special
here, except that I had to leave out double-buffering to conserve memory.
This also simplified the code a bit.
 <P>
The scrolling and color-changing border bars were added for release in the
unexpanded demo collection. Before this addition I considered dropping
this part completely from VIMMII, but now it is cool enough :-)
 <P>


<H3>3k-plasma</H3>

A new implementation made the plasma look a lot better. We'll start with
some background stuff.
 <P>
The VIMM part faked 8-line characters by having three 24-character patterns.
One set has both halves the same, while the others have lighter and darker
bottom halves. Character and border colors can be only from 0 to 7. Two sets
of patterns are needed to switch colors so that character and border colors
are always from 0 to 7, whatever colors are on-screen. The VIMM way thus
needed 2304 bytes for the character patterns, but I found a better way.
The new way only needs three 32-character patterns, 1536 bytes.
 <P>
The major change is that the old version used a fixed map to which a running
offset was added to cycle the colors. The size of the map was 1044 bytes.
Another map was activated while the next part was loaded. I decided to use
a 'real' plasma, which did not need a full map. A sine value is calculated
for each row and column, each location value is the sum of the row and column
values. The frequency and offset of row and columns sines are varied to
morph the display. No map is needed, and the sine table only takes 256 bytes.
 <P>
The scroller is implemented by clearing the multicolor bit in the color
memory in the right places. Because the plasma routine always initializes
the double-buffered color memory, the routine doesn't do actual scrolling,
but plots the pixels anew every frame. Scrolling up emulates 8-line
characters by moving the screen start location and only really scrolling
every second frame. The plasma row sine calculation is properly compensated
so that the plasma display does not jump around. The font is generated from
the ROM font by logically oring with a right-shifted version.
 <P>
The scroller actually demonstrates a dual-color plasma.
 <P>



<H3>3k-split</H3>

a.k.a 19-split came into being from some discussions with Aleksi Eeben.
He and Britelite had a little competition about who could make the most
color splits so I demonstrated an easy way to have two splits in 8 cycles
and mentioned how you can have 21 splits total (two splits each 6 cycles)
if you only have enough memory. Aleksi urged me to make it happen, and
I did a part which had 18 unique background splits with one split rotating
on the foreground.
 <P>
The implementation isn't magic, of course. It is simply 16 lines worth of
<TT>lda #0</TT> and <TT>sta $900f</TT> pairs with some other instructions
thrown in, and each <TT>lda</TT> updated each frame with the right colors.
 <P>


<H3>3k-shekki</H3>

Overlapping chessboards with a wave effect is the part that is most closely
just copied from VIMM. The scroller belov and a graphics line above are
left out, otherwise the code is only slightly changed.


<H3>3k-crediz</H3>

The credits part in VIMM had two overlapping scrolls, one font for each,
totalling 6kB. I had already made an improved version of the horizontal
scroller, omitting the vertical scroller completely. However, even that
improved version used very much too much memory: 3kB for font, two 896-byte
buffers and the same amount for actual display area, totalling 5.6kB.
And that is already over the 5kB limit, without any space reserved for
code, music, video matrix, and other data tables that you end up needing,
which made me a little skeptical, but also quite excited.
 <P>
The display area was filled from the two source buffers, that contained
the characters currently on-screen. Different effects are made by transforming
the data a bit when copying it to the display area. Two buffers were needed
for quarter-character scrolling speed, because horizontal scrolling precision
is only one cycle, i.e. half a character. Data in the other buffer is
one multicolor pixel rotated compared to the first buffer. This slow
scrolling speed was the first feature to remove -- the scroll speed can
easily be allowed to be twice as fast, because quarter of a character per
frame was actually too slow anyway.
 <P>
The source buffers are handled like ring buffers, i.e. when a new column
of a character appears, only that column must be printed to the buffer,
the whole buffer does not need to be scrolled. When copying to display area,
only the source pointers need to be scrolled so that the target data
is moved by one column while the source data remains the same. This
also made it easy to use two buffers, because the same copy routine
could be used, just the source pointers were changed to point to the
right source buffer.
 <P>
Actually, we don't even need to change the pointers at all, but scroll
the video matrix contents instead. At first the columns corresponds to
character codes 0/1..54/55 (two rows, 28 columns). When scrolling new data
is copied to charactes 0 and 1, and the video matrix columns are set
to 2/3..54/55,0/1.
 <P>
But the pointers can be set to point to the font itself instead of the
source buffer (there is only one now, because we eliminated the shifted one),
eliminating the use of a temporary graphics buffer completely.
Now we only have the 3kB font and the 896-byte graphics display area,
and the pointers have the information about which column of which character
corresponds to which column of display data.
 <P>
This is much better than the original, but still too much. The copying
routine requires that each source 'slice' is consequtive 32 bytes and the
effects assume that first line of the font is empty. The character packing
that is used in the 3k-vimmii part can be applied here, the unit is simply
32 bytes instead of 16 bytes, i.e. only identical columns are removed.
To save enough space I had to edit the font more dramatically, I even
left out <TT>WXZ</TT> that were not used in the scrolltext. The result
is 1536 bytes for the font, 84 bytes for the mapping table.
 <P>
The improved scroller allowed two effects and no-effect on-screen
simultaneously. Each character (or in fact each column of a character)
could select any of these. This required a 120-byte table and the effect
code was a little more complicated than necessary. One effect (or no effect)
for the whole display only needs one 40-byte table and simplified effect
code. Also, I had to drop some effects. Two of the remaining ones use
the same data tables and the third leaves the table to 'normal' state
after finishing.
 <P>
Some of the tables are located in color memory (just remember to clear the
top nybble), and the loader is not used anymore, so also that 200 bytes is
free for grabs. Sprinkled on top with Anders Carlsson's very tiny trackplayer
and tune ($90 for music data, $d0 for player) the part is finished.
